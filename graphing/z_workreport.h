    Bugs     : cant enter bad input

    Reflections: this is a great project ,that implemented alot of the
        classes that we wrote previously, I have agin a new understanding
        on top down design and OOP. This project was relatively hard compare
        to other asigment, and I really had a fun time doing it. I would love
        to add as much features as I can to this project
